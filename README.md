# Requirements
Python >=3.5
Pytorch >= 1.0

# Others
Please note that,
- The sampling process is extremely time consuming.
- We repeated the experiments with 10 different seeds and reported the mean result.
- I will optimize the code soon (hopefully before Aug 7th) for better readability and robustness.
